# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I'm Rico Williams, and this is my Cybersecurity Portfolio.
I'm a creative professional with a degree in Information Technology/Multimedia communications and a growing passion for cybersecurity. With years of experience translating complex technical concepts into clear, engaging content, I've supported IT and security teams through visual storytelling, training materials, and awareness campaigns. While I'm newer to the cybersecurity field, I've built a solid foundation through certifications and hands-on learning, and I'm eager to apply my communication skills in a role that helps bridge the gap between security and everyday users.
